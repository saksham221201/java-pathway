Upper Bounded Wildcards

You can use an upper bounded wildcard to relax the restrictions on a variable. For example, say you want to write a method that works on List<Integer>, List<Double>, and List<Number>; you can achieve this by using an upper bounded wildcard.

To declare an upper-bounded wildcard, use the wildcard character ('?'), followed by the extends keyword, followed by its upper bound.
Example: public class WildcardExample<T extends Number> {}
1. WildcardExample<Integer> customArrayList = new WildcardExample<>();
2. WildcardExample<Float> customArrayList = new WildcardExample<>();
3. WildcardExample<Number> customArrayList = new WildcardExample<>();
Are all correct.

public void getList(List<Number> list) {
	// Do something
	// Here we can pass only Number Type
}

public void getList(List<? extends Number> list) {
        // Do something
        // Here we can pass Number, Float, Integer Type
}
